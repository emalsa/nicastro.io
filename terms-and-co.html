                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data
                        being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the
                        data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
                    </li>
                    <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
                    <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively,
                        if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said
                        processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
                    </li>
                    <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same
                        transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
                    </li>
                    <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is
                        being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77
                        GDPR).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such

                    GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a
                    disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
                <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the

                    an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>
                <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
                <p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its
                    storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage
                    obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.</p>

                <h4>Server data</h4>
                <p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server
                    provider will be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files
                    record the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came
                    (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP
                    address from which you visited our site.</p>
                <p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your
                    data.</p>
                <p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the
                    improvement, stability, functionality, and security of our website.</p>
                <p>The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required for
                    evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until
                    the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.</p>

                <h4>Cookies</h4>
                <h5>a) Session cookies</h5>
                <p>We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on
                    your computer by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as
                    your browser, location data, or IP address. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for
                    example, to display our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.</p>
                <p>The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used
                    to collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships.</p>
                <p>If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in
                    improving the functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.</p>
                <p>When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p>
                <h5>b) Third-party cookies</h5>
                <p>If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose
                    of advertising, analyzing, or improving the features of our website.</p>
                <p>Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose
                    of such third-party collection and processing of data collected through cookies.</p>
                <h5>c) Disabling cookies</h5>
                <p>You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the
                    browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required
                    vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or
                    consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot
                    prevent so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to change the setting of your
                    Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also depend on the Flash player you are
                    using. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your
                    Flash player or contact its maker for support.</p>
                <p>If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be
                    fully usable.</p>

                <h4>Order processing</h4>
                <p>The data you submit when ordering goods and/or services from us will have to be processed in order to
                    fulfill your order. Please note that orders cannot be processed without providing this data.</p>
                <p>The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
                <p>After your order has been completed, your personal data will be deleted, but only after the retention
                    periods required by tax and commercial law.</p>
                <p>In order to process your order, we will share your data with the shipping company responsible for
                    delivery to the extent required to deliver your order and/or with the payment service provider to
                    the extent required to process your payment.</p>
                <h5>The legal basis for the transfer of this data is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. </h5>

                <h4>Customer account/registration</h4>
                <p>If you create a customer account with us via our website, we will use the data you entered during
                    registration (e.g. your name, your address, or your email address) exclusively for services leading
                    up to your potential placement of an order or entering some other contractual relationship with us,
                    to fulfill such orders or contracts, and to provide customer care (e.g. to provide you with an
                    overview of your previous orders or to be able to offer you a wishlist function). We also store your
                    IP address and the date and time of your registration. This data will not be transferred to third
                    parties.</p>
                <p>During the registration process, your consent will be obtained for this processing of your data, with
                    reference made to this privacy policy. The data collected by us will be used exclusively to provide
                    your customer account.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>If you give your consent to this processing, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR is the legal basis for this
                    processing.</p>
                <p>If the opening of the customer account is also intended to lead to the initiation of a contractual
                    relationship with us or to fulfill an existing contract with us, the legal basis for this processing
                    is also Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
                <p>You may revoke your prior consent to the processing of your personal data at any time under Art. 7
                    Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your
                    consent.</p>
                <p>The data previously collected will then be deleted as soon as processing is no longer necessary.
                    However, we must observe any retention periods required under tax and commercial law.</p>

                <h4>Newsletter</h4>
                <p>If you register for our free newsletter, the data requested from you for this purpose, i.e. your
                    email address and, optionally, your name and address, will be sent to us. We also store the IP
                    address of your computer and the date and time of your registration. During the registration
                    process, we will obtain your consent to receive this newsletter and the type of content it will
                    offer, with reference made to this privacy policy. The data collected will be used exclusively to
                    send the newsletter and will not be passed on to third parties.</p>
                <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.</p>
                <p>You may revoke your prior consent to receive this newsletter under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future
                    effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent or click on the
                    unsubscribe link contained in each newsletter.</p>

                <h4>Contact</h4>
                <p>If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide will be used for the purpose of
                    processing your request. We must have this data in order to process and answer your inquiry;
                    otherwise we will not be able to answer it in full or at all.</p>
                <p>The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
                <p>Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and there is no further legal
                    obligation to store your data, such as if an order or contract resulted therefrom.</p>

                <h4>User posts, comments, and ratings</h4>
                <p>We offer you the opportunity to post questions, answers, opinions, and ratings on our website,
                    hereinafter referred to jointly as "posts." If you make use of this opportunity, we will process and
                    publish your post, the date and time you submitted it, and any pseudonym you may have used.</p>
                <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your prior consent under Art.
                    7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your
                    consent.</p>
                <p>In addition, we will also process your IP address and email address. The IP address is processed
                    because we might have a legitimate interest in taking or supporting further action if your post
                    infringes the rights of third parties and/or is otherwise unlawful.</p>
                <p>In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in any
                    legal defense we may have to mount.</p>

                <h4>Follow-up comments</h4>
                <p>If you make posts on our website, we also offer you the opportunity to subscribe to any subsequent
                    follow-up comments made by third parties. In order to be able to inform you about these follow-up
                    comments, we will need to process your email address.</p>
                <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your prior consent to this
                    subscription under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you
                    are revoking your consent or click on the unsubscribe link contained in each email.</p>

                <h4>Online job applications / publication of job advertisements</h4>
                <p>We offer you the opportunity to apply for jobs with our company via our website. In the case of these
                    digital applications, we collect your application data electronically in order to process your
                    application.</p>
                <p>The legal basis for this processing is §26 Para. 1 S. 1 BDSG in conjunction with Art. 88 Para. 1
                    GDPR.</p>
                <p>If you are hired as a result of the application process, we will store the data you provide during
                    the application process in your personnel file for the purpose of the usual organizational and
                    administrative process, naturally in compliance with further legal obligations.</p>
                <p>The legal basis for this processing is §26 Para. 1 S. 1 BDSG in conjunction with Art. 88 Para. 1
                    GDPR.</p>
                <p>If we do not hire you, we will automatically delete the data submitted to us two months after the
                    final decision is made. We will not delete the data, however, if we must store the data for legal
                    reasons such as evidence of equal treatment of applicants, until any legal action is concluded, or
                    four months.</p>
                <p>In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR and §24 Para. 1 No. 2 BDSG. Our
                    legitimate interest lies in any legal defense we may have to mount .</p>
                <p>If you expressly consent to a longer storage of your data, e.g. for your inclusion in a database of
                    applicants or interested parties, the data will be processed further on the basis of your consent.
                    The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may withdraw your consent at any time with
                    future effect per Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect.</p>

                <h4>Social media links via graphics</h4>
                <p>We also integrate the following social media sites into our website. The integration takes place via
                    a linked graphic of the respective site. The use of these graphics stored on our own servers
                    prevents the automatic connection to the servers of these networks for their display. Only by
                    clicking on the corresponding graphic will you be forwarded to the service of the respective social
                    network.</p>
                <p>Once you click, that network may record information about you and your visit to our site. It cannot
                    be ruled out that such data will be processed in the United States.</p>
                <p>Initially, this data includes such things as your IP address, the date and time of your visit, and
                    the page visited. If you are logged into your user account on that network, however, the network
                    operator might assign the information collected about your visit to our site to your personal
                    account. If you interact by clicking Like, Share, etc., this information can be stored your personal
                    user account and possibly posted on the respective network. To prevent this, you need to log out of
                    your social media account before clicking on the graphic. The various social media networks also
                    offer settings that you can configure accordingly.</p>

                <p>Shariff is an open source program developed by c't and heise. By integrating this plug-in, linked
                    graphics prevent the following social network plug-ins from automatically establishing a connection
                    to the respective social networks server when you visit website(s) on which the plug-ins are
                    integrated. Only if you click on one of these linked graphics will you be forwarded to the service
                    of the respective social network. Only then will information about your use of our site be recorded
                    by the respective social network. This information may include your IP address, the date and time
                    you visited our site, as well as the pages you viewed.</p>
                <p>If you are logged in to one of the social network services while visiting one of our plugged-in

                    information about your interaction with our site there. If, for example, you use the a share button
                    for the social network, this information may be stored in your user account there and published on
                    the platform of the respective social network provider. To prevent this, you must either log out of

                    network account.</p>

                <p>The Google Analytics service is used to analyze how our website is used. The legal basis is Art. 6
                    Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic
                    operation of our site.</p>
                <p>Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your visits to
                    our website will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However,
                    we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby Google truncates the IP
                    address within the EU or the EEA before it is transmitted to the US.</p>
                <p>The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits
                    to our website and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used to provide other services
                    related to the use of our website and of the internet in general.</p>
                <p>Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data. In addition, Google provides

                    offers you further control over the data that Google collects when you visit our website. The add-on
                    informs Google Analytics' JavaScript (ga.js) that no information about the website visit should be
                    transmitted to Google Analytics. However, this does not prevent information from being transmitted

                    (referrer URL), the duration of your visit, and the frequency of your visits is processed.</p>
                <p>Matomo stores a cookie on your device via your browser in order to collect this data. This cookie is

                    optimization of our website.</p>
                <p>We use Matomo with the "Automatically Anonymize Visitor IPs" function. This anonymization function
                    truncates your IP address by two bytes so that it is impossible to assign it to you or to the

                <h4>Google Remarketing</h4>
                <p>We use the remarketing function on our website. This is a service provided by Google Inc., Gordon
                    House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).</p>
                <p>Through certification according to the EU-US Privacy Shield</p>

                <p>Google guarantees that it will follow the EU's data protection regulations when processing data in
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>We use this feature to deliver interest-based, personalized advertising on third-party websites that
                    also participate in Google's advertising network.</p>
                <p>The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis,
                    optimization, and economic operation of our site.</p>
                <p>To allow this advertising service to function, Google stores a cookie with a sequence of numbers on
                    your device via your browser when you visit our website. This cookie records both your visit and the
                    use of our website in anonymous form. However, personal data will not be passed on. If you
                    subsequently visit a third-party website that also uses the Google advertising network, advertising
                    may appear that refers to our website or our offers there.</p>

                <p><strong>Cross-device marketing</strong> allows Google to track your usage patterns across multiple
                    devices, so you may see interest-based, personalized advertising even when you switch devices.
                    However, this requires that you have agreed to link your browsing history to your existing Google
                    account.</p>

                <h4>Microsoft Bing Ads</h4>
                <p>Our website uses Bing Ads for remarketing and follow-up. This is a service of Microsoft Corporation,
                    One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052 - 6399, USA, hereinafter referred to as "Microsoft", based on
                    so-called Universal Event Tracking (UEN).</p>
                <p>Through certification according to the EU-US Privacy Shield</p>

                    legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our site.</p>
                <p>If you click on an advertisement placed by us on the Bing search engine, Microsoft stores a cookie on
                    your terminal device to track your activity via your browser. This cookie expires after 180 days and
                    is not used for personal identification. If you visit certain pages of our website and the cookie
                    has not yet expired, both Microsoft and we may recognize that you have clicked on an advertisement
                    placed by us at Bing and have been forwarded to our website from there.</p>
                <p>Microsoft uses the information collected by the tracking cookie to compile visit statistics for us.
                    This provides us with information on the number of hits triggered by the advertising placed on Bing
                    and which pages on our site were subsequently accessed. However, we do not receive any information
                    that could be used to identify you personally.</p>
                <p>In addition, Microsoft may be able to track your user behavior across multiple devices using
                    cross-device tracking. This enables Microsoft to display personalized advertising across all
                    devices.</p>
                <p>If you do not agree to this processing, you have the option of preventing the installation of cookies
                    by making the appropriate settings in your browser. Further details can be found in the section
                    about cookies above.</p>
                <p>If you have a Microsoft account, you can also change the settings for personalized advertising there
